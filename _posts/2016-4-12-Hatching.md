title: Coming out of the shell!

Globalization has already hit Bangladesh (and most countries for that matter) pretty heavily.  Incidentally, I’ve just finished reading a book. There it mentions (and I agree) how globalization facilitates horizontal growth i.e. replication of something that has worked well somewhere else.  I’m all for that. But my fear is that, given the current scenario, Bangladesh might just limit itself within that kind of growth. What Bangladesh needs alongside and loads of it is vertical growth i.e. creating something of value on its own, something fundamental to this land and contribute in the global fabric of development.
